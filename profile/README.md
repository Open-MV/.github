# The Open Metaverse Foundation Resources

Welcome to the Open Metaverse Foundation (OMF). This is a central location for information related to our work, the processes our projects uses and how to contribute with them. 

First and foremost, ensure you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [values](values.md) guides. Then reach out to *Foundational Interest Groups* (FIGs) that are involved in the areas you want to contribute to.

## What is the current structure of OMF?
The Foundation is divided in eight Foundational Interest Groups (FIGs). Each FIG is responsible for the discussions and proposals of certain points related to the open metaverse structure. The current FIGs, links to resources, and its responsibilities may be found below.

## Links and resources table below

Each FIG has an area that explains its role and purpose. You will find the links for current and previous meeting recordings and minutes as well as the agenda for future meetings. Daily conversations occur on [Discord](https://discord.gg/openmetaverse), [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openmetaverse/shared_invite/zt-1nm1r7t06-AAP4s69ZY2b_zMyur0aS3g), and our [Mailing Lists](https://lists.openmv.org/g/main). Each group has features that they are focused on, and the working tickets for issues can be found in the interest area.

## How can you contribute?

**Participate in the meetings**
As we just started our works, joining the meetings is essential to give feedback and influence how the future metaverse will look like. Everyone is welcome and, for every group, we have an agenda posted few days before, and we also need people who volunteer for taking notes or even facilitate the meetings!

You can also check out our [calendar](https://lists.openmv.org/g/calendar/calendar) for events and past meeting notes.

**Contribute in our documentation and guidelines**
Whether it's filing an issue, updating existing docs, or even writing completely new docs - we highly appreciate all efforts to improving the documentation. We are still developing standard ways to take notes as of now!
